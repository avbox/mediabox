# Note: BusyBox init doesn't support runlevels.  The runlevels field is

# sysvinit.

# Format for each entry: <id>:<runlevels>:<action>:<process>
#
# id        == tty to run on, or empty for /dev/console
# runlevels == ignored
# action    == one of sysinit, respawn, askfirst, wait, and once
# process   == program to run

# Startup the system
::sysinit:/bin/mediabox --init

# Put a getty on the serial port
console::respawn:/sbin/getty -L  console 0 vt100 # GENERIC_SERIAL

# Stuff to do before rebooting
::shutdown:killall mediabox
